# Implementation by Python 🐍

I believe that we don't really understand algorithms until we try to implement them 😁.
That's why I sometimes enjoy developing some famous algorithm 😎.
Also, sometimes they are part of my school assignments 😅.

I really love functional pattern 🤩 and always try to build a good functional api to use these algorithms.

All these works are going to be my collection of examples in the future 🧐.
But it could also be a functional framework 😍 to use these algorithms in other projects.
